# Development progress

## 2026-11-05 — M0

- Public GitHub repository established: `ilievi187/FASTLINK`.
- Apache-2.0 Rust implementation with a documented binary wire protocol.
- BLAKE3 chunk-addressed cache, exact deduplication, changed-chunk transfer.
- RAW/RLE lossless codec with size-based selection and bounded reconstruction.
- Loopback-only TCP CLI: `fastlink serve` and `fastlink send`.
- Five Rust unit tests passed; rustfmt, clippy and release compilation passed locally.
- 8 MiB synthetic local test: cold payload 1,552 B; warm payload 0 B; one-byte delta 518 B.
- SHA-256 of source and output matched; byte comparison passed.

**Explicit limitation:** This does not yet accelerate GPU inference; no GPU benchmarks exist for FASTLINK's new Rust transport. This log is not a measure of real RPC performance.
